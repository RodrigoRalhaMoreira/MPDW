## Project description

This project is made in the context of the course "Web Search and Data Mining" of the Master in Computer Science at the Nova FCT university.
The aim is to create a chatbot extension that can be used on the [Farfetch](farfetch.com) website to search items and eventually get recommandations based on the user's preferences.
It's based on the already existing extension [iFetch](https://github.com/pmvalente171/iFetch-Chrome-Extension)
